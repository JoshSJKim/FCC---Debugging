# FCC---Debugging

JavaScript debugging module

## Use JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable

- The console.log() method displays the output of what's specified within the parentheses of the console.
- This is one of the most helpful tool debugging your code.
- Placing the console.log() at various strategic points in the code can show you the intermediate values of variables.
- It's a good idea to develop a habit of performing interim checks on your code.
- It will help narrow down the bug.
- It is also good practice to have a good idea of what the output should be rather than relying on the console.log()

## Browser Console

- The FCC console behaves a bit differently compared to the browser console.
- FCC console only displays 'log' messages, whereas the browser console will output all messages.
- When changes are made to the code, it runs automatically and shows the relevant logs.
- However, FCC console clears all messages except for the log messages.

- Use the 'inspect' tool on the browser to view the browser console.
